This small python script is able to generate a complete sudoku board
using a brute force method.

Starting in the top left hand corner of the board:
1. Collect all the values in the current row (horizontal)
2. Collect all the values in the current column (vertical)
3. Collect all the values in the current block
4. Generate a list of all values which don't appear in any
of the collected values
5. Place a random available number in the current position
6. Shift to the next position to the right and repeat steps
1-5 until all positions are filled.

If the board is not complete, but there are no available values
for the current position, destroy the board and restart
with a blank one. Not a very good use of resources and may be 
revised at a later date.

The beginnings of a solver are also underway. Instead of going
the usual route and using a brute force method to solve, I've
decided to rather attempt something closer to human interaction.
This will have the added benefit of being able to more accurately
measure the difficulty of generated boards.
