This small python script is able to generate a sudoku board
using a brute force method.

Starting in the top left hand corner of the board:
1. Collect all the values in the current row (horizontal)
2. Collect all the values in the current column (vertical)
3. Collect all the values in the current block
4. Generate a list of all values which don't appear in any
of the collected values
5. Place a random available number in the current position
6. Shift to the next position to the right and repeat steps
1-5 until all positions are filled.

If the board is not complete, but there are no available values
for the current position, destroy the board and restart
with a blank one.
