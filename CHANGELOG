Got the urge to redo this recently. Only took a few minutes.
It's a bit neater/better than the previous iteration.

Might work a bit on a brute force solver in the not too distant
future.

The Sudoku generator is still a prototype and will most like have issues.
At the moment it uses a brute force method to generate a board.

A way to remove random digits and classify the difficulty of the board is
still outstanding.

There are also a large number of hardcoded values and few comments, but I
will update this when I get a chance.
